#### Original idea: Laptop cart check out

Needs larger problem base so:
	New problem implementing school map showing location of each teacher inside of the school.

The room will show:
- which teacher is in which room
- iPad checked out to this room
- Laptops checked out
- library: space, cards, late notices.
- Labs/ rooms to reserve.
- lockers
- Maintenance work orders.
- Club meetings
- safety notice(fight, lock down)
- who is on bus duty today
